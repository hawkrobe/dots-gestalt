All experiments were run across 2 sessions in the lab using [DMDX](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kforster/dmdx/dmdx.htm). The `lines` directory was used in one session and the `no_lines` stimuli directory was used in the other.

* *piloting* was used to calibrate stimulus intensity (see paper Appendix).
* experiment 1 tested orientation with 'control' trials and 'configural' trials separated into different blocks (experimenter manually loaded the other .rtf file after the participant completed on blocked).
* experiment 2 tested orientation with these trials mixed together
* experiment 3 tested proximity
